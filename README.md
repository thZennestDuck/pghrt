# PGHRT

This is the source code, just in case you wanted to build it yourself for some reason. Or difference tracking line edits. I should've had this originally, but I didn't, sooooo don't worry about it too much. The edits are for posterity more than they are "crucial info that everyone should look at" generally speaking, especially beacuse it's intended to be a resource that is iterated upon and reviewed over time.

If you are interested in doing a translation or some sort of alternate version, please get in touch!
